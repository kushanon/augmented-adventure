Tomorrow we will travel with the help of augmented reality applications.

Augmented Adventure uses augmented reality library AR.js with A-Frame and Google Places API for getting information about places.


# How it works? 

Application fetch data from Google Paces API. Data contains main attractions in a specified range. For each attraction an costum made icon is shown, which represesnt a specific attraction.
After user clicks on an icon, another API call is made to get inforamtions about a place, such as opening hours, ratings and an image.
